RadioFlow: Multi-Agent Radiology Workflow System
MedGemma Impact Challenge Submission

Project Overview:
RadioFlow is a multi-agent AI system that demonstrates how artificial intelligence could transform radiology workflows. It uses a 4-agent orchestrated pipeline where specialized AI agents collaborate to analyze chest X-rays, interpret findings, generate reports, and assess priority.

The Problem We're Solving:
Radiology departments worldwide face a critical crisis. Over 700 million imaging studies are performed annually in the US alone. There's a 30% or higher burnout rate among radiologists. Each chest X-ray takes an average of 5 to 10 minutes for preliminary reading. And there's limited access to radiologist expertise in underserved regions.

Current clinical workflows require radiologists to manually analyze each image for abnormalities, interpret findings in clinical context, generate structured reports, and determine case urgency and routing. This sequential, manual process creates bottlenecks, delays critical findings communication, and contributes to physician burnout.

Our Solution - The 4-Agent Pipeline:

Agent 1 is the CXR Analyzer. It processes chest X-ray images and extracts visual features and patterns. Think of it as the "eyes" of the system, looking at the X-ray and noting what it sees - density variations, opacities, and structural anomalies.

Agent 2 is the Finding Interpreter, powered by Google's MedGemma. It takes the visual observations from Agent 1 and interprets them into clinical language. It generates differential diagnoses and possible etiologies. For example, if Agent 1 detects increased density in the lower lung zones, Agent 2 interprets this as "findings consistent with pleural effusion" and suggests possible causes like congestive heart failure or pneumonia.

Agent 3 is the Report Generator, also powered by MedGemma. It creates structured radiology reports following standard clinical formats, complete with technique, findings, impression, and recommendations sections. The reports look professional and follow the conventions that radiologists expect.

Agent 4 is the Priority Router, using MedGemma for priority assessment. It evaluates the urgency of findings and determines how the case should be routed - whether it needs STAT reading for critical findings, urgent review, or routine reporting.

What Makes This "Agentic":
Each agent has a specific role with clear responsibility. They produce structured output that flows to the next agent. They maintain context throughout the pipeline. They can be independently tested and improved. And there are explicit handoffs between agents. This modular design means each component can be upgraded independently, the system fails gracefully if one part has issues, and the workflow is observable and explainable.

MedGemma Integration:
We use Google's MedGemma 4B-IT model for three of the four agents. On Apple Silicon Macs, we run MedGemma locally using MLX with 4-bit quantization. This allows real inference without needing cloud APIs or expensive GPUs. For other environments, we provide a Kaggle notebook that runs on free GPU resources.

Current Scope and Honest Limitations:
The image analysis in this demo uses pattern-based feature extraction. For production deployment, this would need to be replaced with Google's CXR Foundation model or similar validated medical imaging AI. The system is designed for chest X-rays specifically - orthopedic or other imaging types are not supported.

Impact Potential:
If deployed at scale, this type of system could save 2 to 4 minutes per study. For a radiologist reviewing 50 to 100 studies per day, that's 1.5 to 6 hours of time savings daily. It could reduce documentation burden by 40 to 60 percent while ensuring consistent, standardized reporting across every case.

Most importantly, RadioFlow demonstrates how multi-agent AI systems can augment radiologists rather than replace them. The AI handles the preliminary analysis and documentation, freeing the radiologist to focus on complex cases and patient care.

This project was built for the MedGemma Impact Challenge 2026 to demonstrate practical applications of Google's Health AI Developer Foundations.
