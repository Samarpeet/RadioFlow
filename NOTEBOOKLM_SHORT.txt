RadioFlow: Multi-Agent Radiology AI

RadioFlow is a multi-agent AI system for chest X-ray analysis built for the MedGemma Impact Challenge.

THE PROBLEM:
Radiologists face burnout from reading hundreds of X-rays daily. Each study takes 5-10 minutes of manual work.

THE SOLUTION:
RadioFlow uses 4 specialized AI agents working together:

Agent 1 - The Analyzer: Examines the X-ray image and identifies patterns like opacities, density changes, and structural abnormalities.

Agent 2 - The Interpreter: Powered by MedGemma, it translates visual findings into clinical language and suggests possible diagnoses.

Agent 3 - The Report Writer: Also using MedGemma, it generates professional radiology reports with findings, impressions, and recommendations.

Agent 4 - The Priority Router: Uses MedGemma to assess urgency and flag critical cases needing immediate attention.

WHY IT'S AGENTIC:
Each agent has one job, passes results to the next, and can be independently improved. This modular design makes the system observable, explainable, and scalable.

MEDGEMMA'S ROLE:
Google's MedGemma powers 3 of the 4 agents, handling clinical text interpretation and report generation. We run it locally on Mac using MLX with 4-bit quantization.

THE IMPACT:
This workflow could save radiologists hours daily while ensuring consistent, professional reports for every case.

Built for the MedGemma Impact Challenge 2026.
